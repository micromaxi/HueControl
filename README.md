HueControl
==========

*Just a heads up: This is my first open source project, first use of most of the python plugins 
and first time use of git (and github), so bear with me. :)*

HueControl is a python application to control your Philips Hue bridge and lights. 
See http://www.meethue.com for more information about these products. It is based on cherrypy, so it will
serve a webpages with information about the lights and options to control them.

HueControl also is a framework for you to create your own plugins. You can also install this quite easily on a
raspberry pi, just make sure you have git and python installed.
